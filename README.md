# Inverse Kinematics

In this project a simple 3D arm with multiple interconnecting links are used to demonstrate the practical aspects of Inverse Kinematics.

## Features

* Implemented using FABRIK
* Constraints applied to some joints
* End effector animated using spline interpolation 
* Multiple types of interpolations done - Cubic, Hermite, Bezier, B-Spline
